# BriCS HPC Responsible AI-Generated Code Skill

This skill guides agents in producing correct, safe, and policy-compliant code
for the Bristol Centre for Supercomputing (BriCS) HPC facilities.

---

## Core Principles

Always follow these rules when generating or suggesting code for BriCS systems.

| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Shared resource respect** | Never generate code that runs heavy workloads directly on login nodes |
| **Accurate resource requests** | Always estimate realistic `--time`, `--gpus`, `--ntasks` in job scripts |
| **Storage awareness** | Use the correct storage area; never assume data persists after project end |
| **Policy compliance** | All generated code must be consistent with the BriCS Acceptable Use Policy |
| **Architecture awareness** | Isambard-AI and Isambard 3 Grace are **aarch64 (Arm64)**; MACS has mixed archs |
| **Verify before submit** | Always review AI-generated scripts before `sbatch`—especially resource flags |

---

## Quick Decision Table

| Task | Correct approach |
|---|---|
| Run a short test command | `srun --time=00:05:00 [--gpus=1] <cmd>` |
| Run a batch workload | Write a script; submit with `sbatch` |
| Install Python packages | Conda (Miniforge) or `uv`; never `pip install --user` in $HOME |
| Share data with project members | Write to `$PROJECTDIR` |
| Share data with all users | Write to `$PROJECTDIR_PUBLIC` |
| Temporary/intermediate data | Use `$SCRATCHDIR` (auto-deleted after 60 days on Isambard 3) |
| Fast in-job scratch | Use `$LOCALDIR` (wiped at job end) |
| Long job (>24h) | Break into chained jobs with `--dependency=afterok:<JOBID>` |
| Check quota | `lfs quota -hp $(lfs project -d $SCRATCHDIR \| awk '{print $1}') $SCRATCHDIR` |

---

## Slurm Job Scripts

### Isambard-AI (GPU — GH200)

Each GPU requested allocates **1 Grace Hopper Superchip** = 1 GH200 GPU + 72 CPU cores + 115 GiB RAM.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_job
#SBATCH --output=my_job_%j.out
#SBATCH --gpus=1                # Required: always specify GPU resource
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00         # Required: set a realistic time limit (max 24h)

module load cray-python         # Or activate your Conda/venv environment
python3 my_script.py
```

**Gotchas for Isambard-AI:**
- You MUST specify `--gpus` (or `--gpus-per-*`). Jobs without GPU directives will fail.
- The default partition is `workq`. Do not specify a partition unless you have a reason.
- Maximum walltime is **24 hours**. For longer jobs, use `--dependency=afterok:<JOBID>`.
- Project GPU limit: **32 GPUs** across all running jobs (`32gpu_qos`).

### Isambard 3 (CPU — Grace)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_cpu_job
#SBATCH --output=my_cpu_job_%j.out
#SBATCH --ntasks=4
#SBATCH --time=02:00:00         # Max 24h on grace partition

module load cray-python
srun python3 my_script.py
```

### Multi-step / parallel job steps

```bash
# Run two job steps concurrently on separate GPUs
srun --ntasks=1 --gpus=1 --exclusive step_a.sh &
srun --ntasks=1 --gpus=1 --exclusive step_b.sh &
wait
```

### Chaining long workloads (>24h)

```bash
# Chain jobs that save/restore state
JOBID_1=$(sbatch --parsable job_part1.sh)
JOBID_2=$(sbatch --parsable --dependency=afterok:${JOBID_1} job_part2.sh)
```

## Storage Spaces

All storage is **working storage — not backed up**. Data is deleted at project end.

| Variable | Path | Purpose | Quota (Isambard-AI) | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `$HOME` | `/home/<PROJECT>/<USER>.<PROJECT>` | Config files, scripts, job outputs | 100 GiB | Project end |
| `$SCRATCHDIR` | `/scratch/<PROJECT>/<USER>.<PROJECT>` | Intermediate job data, containers | 5 TiB | 60 days (i3) / Project end (iAI) |
| `$PROJECTDIR` | `/projects/<PROJECT>` | Shared datasets, shared environments | 200 TiB | Project end |
| `$PROJECTDIR_PUBLIC` | `/projects/public/<PROJECT>` | Data readable by all users | 200 TiB | Project end |
| `$LOCALDIR` | `/local/user/<UID>` | Fast RAM-backed in-job scratch | 48 GiB (compute) | End of job/session |

**Critical reminders:**
- **Never use `/tmp` directly.** `/tmp` is node-local, may have very limited space, and is not reliably available or cleaned up across the cluster. Always reference storage locations through their environment variables (`$SCRATCHDIR`, `$LOCALDIR`, etc.) and use `set -eu` at the top of job scripts to catch unset variables early:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -eu   # Exit on error (-e); treat unset variables as errors (-u)

WORKDIR="${SCRATCHDIR}/myjob_${SLURM_JOB_ID}"
mkdir -p "${WORKDIR}"

# ... your work here ...

# Explicitly clean up at end of job — do not rely on automated deletion
rm -rf "${WORKDIR}"
```

- `$HOME` is for scripts and configs — **not large datasets**.
- **The 100 GiB `$HOME` quota fills silently through tool caches, not through anything you put there on
  purpose.** Observed 2026-09-17: 103 GiB used against a 101 GiB limit, of which `~/.cache/huggingface`
  held 56 GiB (a FLUX.2 4-bit checkpoint 32 GiB, SD3-medium 15 GiB, three NV-Generate models), `~/.cache/modelscope`
  21 GiB from a run ten months earlier, `~/.cache/torch` 1.4 GiB (torchvision / LPIPS weights), a 3.6 GiB
  venv a tool had just created under `~/.cache`. The first symptoms are not about disk: `git push` fails with
  `unable to get credential storage lock ... Disk quota exceeded`, `claude plugin update` fails with
  `could not create work tree dir`, and any job writing a log under `$HOME` dies. Check with `quota -s`
  (the `home` line: space used against the limit) and `du -sh --apparent-size ~/.cache/*`. Keep the caches
  off `$HOME` from the start by exporting, in `.bashrc`, `HF_HOME`, `MODELSCOPE_CACHE`, `TORCH_HOME`,
  `UV_CACHE_DIR`, `PIP_CACHE_DIR` and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` to a directory under `$PROJECTDIR` or your workspace on
  Lustre; when it has already happened, move the directory there and leave a symlink in place
  (`rsync -a src/ dst/`, compare file counts and byte totals, `rm -rf src && ln -s dst src`): every reader
  keeps working and 77 GiB came back in four minutes. Model files that a running job has mapped stay valid
  while the move happens, because the inode lives until it is unmapped.
- `$LOCALDIR` on compute nodes is a **tmpfs RAM disk** — very fast but limited, and on a login or tunnel
  session it is also where `$TMPDIR` points, so a tool that caches under `$TMPDIR` is spending the session's
  memory cap and loses the cache at logout.
- Never assume `$LOCALDIR` data survives between jobs.
- Backup important results off-system before the project end date.

## Login Nodes — What NOT to Do

Login nodes are **shared** and must not be used for compute-intensive or long-running work.

| Allowed on login node | NOT allowed on login node |
|---|---|
| Editing files | Running model training |
| Compiling small programs | Running data preprocessing pipelines |
| Submitting/monitoring jobs | Running benchmarks or tests |
| File transfer and compression | Long `python` / `bash` loops |
| Building containers | Using `watch` with `squeue -i` repeatedly |

> Using `squeue -i` or `watch squeue` excessively disrupts **all users** and is a breach of the Acceptable Use Policy. Use `squeue --me` once to check, or set a reasonable interval.

---

## Software and Environments

### Python — Recommended approach

```bash
# Install Miniforge (once per user)
cd $HOME
curl --location --remote-name \
  "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
rm Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh

# Activate (each session — do NOT use conda init)
source ~/miniforge3/bin/activate

# Create and use isolated environments
conda create -n myenv python=3.11
conda activate myenv
conda install 
```

**Gotchas:**
- Do NOT run `conda init` — it modifies shell startup scripts and causes problems.
- Do NOT install packages in the base Conda environment.
- Do NOT use `pip install --user`; it installs into `$HOME/.local` which is shared across architectures (aarch64 and x86_64 on Isambard 3) — use venvs instead.
- Isambard-AI and Isambard 3 Grace are **aarch64**. Many PyPI wheels do not support aarch64; use conda-forge or build from source.

### Architecture check in scripts

```bash
# In .bashrc or setup scripts, guard architecture-specific code:
if [ "$(arch)" == "x86_64" ]; then
    source ~/miniforge3/bin/activate  # x86_64 env
elif [ "$(arch)" == "aarch64" ]; then
    source ~/miniforge3_arm/bin/activate  # aarch64 env
fi
```

### Modules

```bash
module avail          # List available modules
module load cray-python   # Load Cray Python (pre-installed)
```

---

## Connecting to BriCS (Clifton + SSH)

```bash
# Install Clifton (Linux)
curl -L https://github.com/isambard-sc/clifton/releases/latest/download/clifton-linux-musl-x86_64 -o clifton
chmod u+x clifton && mv clifton ~/.local/bin/

# Authenticate (required daily)
clifton auth

# Write SSH config (only needed when added to a new project)
clifton ssh-config write

# Connect
ssh .aip2.isambard    # Isambard-AI Phase 2
ssh .3.isambard       # Isambard 3
```

**Gotchas:**
- SSH certificates are valid for **12 hours only** — run `clifton auth` each day.
- Login nodes are assigned randomly; you cannot request a specific login node.
- Do NOT leave persistent `tmux`/`screen` sessions on login nodes — they violate security policy and may be terminated without warning.

---

## Managing Jobs

```bash
squeue --me                        # View your running/pending jobs
sacct                              # View current and completed jobs
scancel                     # Cancel a job
salloc --gpus=1 --time=00:30:00    # Reserve a node interactively (always set --time)
```

**Gotchas:**
- Always cancel `salloc` allocations with `scancel <JOBID>` when finished.
- Use `--time-min` and `--time` together to allow backfill scheduling.
- Batch array jobs (`--array`) can strain the scheduler — prefer chained job steps where possible.

## Responsible AI-Generated Code Checklist

Before submitting any AI-generated code or job script to BriCS:

- [ ] **Resource requests are realistic** — `--time`, `--gpus`, `--ntasks` match your actual workload
- [ ] **No heavy computation on the login node** — all intensive work is inside a job script
- [ ] **Correct storage variable used** — large inputs/outputs go to `$SCRATCHDIR` or `$PROJECTDIR`, not `$HOME`
- [ ] **Architecture is correct** — code compiles/runs on aarch64 if targeting Isambard-AI or Isambard 3 Grace
- [ ] **Python packages are in a virtual environment** — not installed globally or with `--user`
- [ ] **No persistent sessions** — `tmux`/`screen` used only within a job, not left on login nodes
- [ ] **Quota checked** — storage usage is within limits before staging large datasets
- [ ] **Data backed up** — important results are copied off-system; nothing is assumed to persist
- [ ] **Policy compliance** — usage is consistent with the BriCS Acceptable Use Policy
- [ ] **Job output reviewed** — check `sacct` or output files after a job completes

---

## Common Gotchas Summary

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No `--gpus` on Isambard-AI | Job fails | Always include `--gpus=1` (or more) |
| Running compute on login node | Account suspension | Use `sbatch`/`srun` |
| `pip install --user` across archs | Package conflicts | Use Conda env or venv |
| `conda init` in `.bashrc` | Shell startup failures | Use `source ~/miniforge3/bin/activate` |
| Leaving data in `$SCRATCHDIR` for >60 days (Isambard 3) | Data deleted | Move to `$PROJECTDIR` or back up |
| Persistent `tmux` on login node | Session terminated | Submit long jobs via Slurm |
| Using `watch` with any Slurm command | Disrupts scheduler for all users; AUP violation | Never combine `watch` with `squeue`, `sinfo`, `sacct`, or similar — check once manually |
| Using `/tmp` directly in scripts | `/tmp` is node-local, not guaranteed to exist, and not cleaned up reliably | Use `$SCRATCHDIR`, `$LOCALDIR`, or a subdirectory of a known env variable |
| Leaving temp files in `$SCRATCHDIR` or `$LOCALDIR` after a job | Wastes quota; may cause future jobs to fail on space | Explicitly delete temp files at the end of your job script |
| Raising a support ticket for a known outage | Unnecessary load on the helpdesk | Always check https://status.isambard.ac.uk before submitting a ticket |
| Forgetting `clifton auth` | SSH fails | Run daily before connecting |
| Model and package caches left at their defaults under `~/.cache` | `$HOME` hits its 100 GiB quota unnoticed; `git push`, plugin installs and log writes then fail with "Disk quota exceeded" | Export `HF_HOME`, `MODELSCOPE_CACHE`, `TORCH_HOME`, `UV_CACHE_DIR`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME` to Lustre; move an existing cache and symlink it (see Storage Spaces) |
